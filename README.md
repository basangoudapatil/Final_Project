**Problem Statement - 1**

**Predicting Breast Cancer in a Patient**

**Abstract:**
Breast cancer represents one of the diseases that make a high number of deaths every year. It is the most common type of all cancers and the main cause of women's deaths worldwide. Classification and data mining methods are an effective way to classify data. Especially in the medical field, where those methods are widely used in diagnosis and analysis to make decisions.

**Problem Statement:**
Given the details of cell nuclei taken from breast mass, predict whether or not a patient has breast cancer using the Ensembling Techniques. Perform necessary exploratory data analysis before building the model and evaluate the model based on performance metrics other than model accuracy.

**Dataset Information:**
The dataset consists of several predictor variables and one target variable, Diagnosis. The target variable has values 'Benign' and 'Malignant', where 'Benign' means that the cells are not harmful or there is no cancer and 'Malignant' means that the patient has cancer and the cells have a harmful effect. The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

**Scope:**
● Analysing the available data and exploring relationships among given variables
● Data Pre-processing
● Training SVM classifier to predict whether the patient has cancer or not
● Assess the correctness in classifying data with respect to efficiency and effectiveness of
the SVM classifier in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity and AUC ROC
● Tuning the hyperparameters of SVM Classifier provided by the scikit-learn library


**Problem Statement - 2:**

**E-Commerce Customer Segmentation**

**Abstract:**
A key challenge for e-commerce businesses is to analyze the trend in the market to increase their sales. The trend can be easily observed if the companies can group the customers; based on their activity on the ecommerce site. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on.

**Problem Statement:**
Given the e-commerce data, use k-means clustering algorithm to cluster customers with similar interest.

**Dataset Information:**
The data was collected from a well known e-commerce website over a period of time based on the customer’s search profile.

**Scope:**
● Analyzing the existing customer data and getting valuable insights
about the purchase pattern
● Data pre-processing including missing value treatment
● Segmenting customer based on the optimum number of clusters (‘k’)
with the help of silhouette score
